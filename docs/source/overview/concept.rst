Concept
=======

Kademlia is a **DHT**, which stands for **D**\ istributed **H**\ ash
**T**\ able.

Basically it is unordered map, where the *keys* and *values* are stored
on a *decentralized* network, i.e. a network without central server.

Without central server, the network is more scalable and fault tolerant.
This protocol is not perfect regarding security and it is assumed that every
network participant is benevolent.
